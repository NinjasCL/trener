# Trener Project Challenge

This was a project originally made for _Software Construction_ undergraduate course (2012) at https://www.uvm.cl[Universidad de Viña del Mar].

## Merval Metro System

http://www.merval.cl[Merval (Metro Valparaíso)] is a train/metro system that travels between https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valpara%C3%ADso[Valparaíso] to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limache[Limache].

## Requirements

The software must provide the following features.

### Must: Return the next train

Given the current _hour_, _day_, _destination_ and _origin_ the software *must* return the nearest train that will travel from _origin_ to _destination_. 

### Must: Return the total travel cost

Given the _hour_, _day_, _origin_, _destination_ and _user category_ the software *must* return the total travel cost.

### Should: Optional Requirements 

- Return the total travel time.
- Show a list of near trains.
- Show the prices for the other user categories.
- Alert the user when a train is near the station.
- Enable the user to set a default origin, destination.
- Other quality of life improvements.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available (in Spanish) at _docs_ directory. An example implementation was made using _XCode_ for _iPhone_ devices, available at _example_.

## Database

Some _csv_ files and a _sqlite_ database are provided with all the needed data to implement this software, available at _data_.
For _React_ projects you can use https://github.com/agershun/alasql[AlaSQL]. Data is available as _trener.json_ or _trener.js_.

## Challenge

Implement this software in the stack that you are most proficient. Maybe a website with _React_ or an app with _React Native_.
