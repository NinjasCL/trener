# Trener Project Challenge

This was a project originally made for _Software Construction_ undergraduate course (2012) at https://www.uvm.cl[Universidad de Viña del Mar].

## Merval Metro System

https://www.merval.cl[Merval (Metro Valparaíso)] is a train/metro system that travels between https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valpara%C3%ADso[Valparaíso] to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limache[Limache].

## Requirements

The software must provide the following features.

### Return the next train

Given the current _hour_, _day_, _destination_ and _origin_ the software *must* return the nearest train that will travel from _origin_ to _destination_. 

Additionally *should* return the total travel time.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available (in Spanish) at _docs_ directory. An example implementation was made using _XCode_ for _iPhone_ devices, available at _example_.

## Database

Some _csv_ files and a _sqlite_ database is provided with all the needed data to implement this software, available at _data_.
